# Karamoja_Food_Analysis
Food Security Data Analysis for Karamoja region of Uganda
Introduction
Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks. In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.To do so, i developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images.

Objectives
1.To develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. 2.To use this tool as a Food Security Monitoring tool 3.To use maps in the dashboard

Questions
Which District produces the highest and lowest maize and Sorghum
Which subcounties produce highest and lowest maize and sorghum
How arears are distributed in Uganda map
What is the relationship betwen crop yield and population
Data Source
The data source contains three CSV files
